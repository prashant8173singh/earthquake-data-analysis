# 🌍 Earthquake Data Analysis & Dashboard (Japan, 2000–2023)

This project presents an end-to-end analysis of earthquake events in Japan between 2000 and 2023. Using Python for data exploration and Power BI for interactive visualization, it highlights patterns in earthquake frequency, magnitude, depth, and geography.

## 📌 Analytical Questions Explored

This project addresses the following key questions:

1. How many earthquakes occurred in Japan between 2000 to 2023?
2. What is the average number of earthquakes per year during this period?
3. What was the largest magnitude recorded, and where/when did it occur?
4. What were the deepest and shallowest earthquakes? Where were they located?
5. What is the yearly trend of earthquake occurrences in Japan?
6. How has earthquake magnitude changed over the years?
7. What are the most common magnitudes?
8. Which top 10 cities experienced the most earthquakes?
9. Where are the geographical hotspots for earthquakes in Japan?
10. What is the relationship between depth and magnitude?
11. Which earthquakes are outliers in terms of magnitude or depth?
12. What percentage of earthquakes had a magnitude greater than 6?
13. How does earthquake frequency vary across seasons?
14. What is the average time gap between earthquakes over the years?
15. How does Japan’s Earthquake Alert System function?

## 📊 Key Insights

- Most earthquakes occurred between 2011–2012, peaking after the Tōhoku earthquake.
- Earthquakes are more frequent along the Pacific coast and subduction zones.
- Strong quakes (magnitude > 6) make up a notable portion.
- No Clear patterns exist between magnitude and depth.
- Time between quakes has decreased in recent years due to increased minor quakes.
